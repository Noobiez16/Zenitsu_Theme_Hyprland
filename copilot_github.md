Objective: "Perform a comprehensive refinement of the Waybar and swaync notification system. This involves correcting a font glyph rendering issue for workspace icons, re-architecting the notification control center's position and animation, applying a themed transparent style, and unifying all system-level notifications to be processed exclusively by swaync."

Context:
"The project is in an advanced state, but key integration points are misaligned.

    Waybar Workspaces: The hyprland/workspaces module fails to render the specified lightning bolt icons (), indicating a CSS font-family resolution issue. The current global font declaration is not being applied correctly or is being overridden.

    Swaync Positioning: The notification control center currently appears in the top-right, while the desired behavior is for it to animate upwards from its corresponding Waybar icon in the bottom-right. This requires adjusting the control-center specific position properties within swaync's config.json.   

    Swaync Theming: The current notification style is opaque. The requirement is for a semi-transparent background that still incorporates the Zenitsu theme's borders and colors.

    Notification Fragmentation: System events like volume/mute changes are generating separate, un-themed notifications (likely via a secondary OSD or another daemon), breaking the unified aesthetic. All notifications must be channeled through swaync."

Constraints:
"All modifications must be made to existing configuration files (~/.config/waybar/style.css, ~/.config/swaync/config.json, ~/.config/swaync/style.css, and ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf). No new files should be created. All icons must be sourced from the 'FiraCode Nerd Font' or a compatible Nerd Font. The aesthetic must remain consistent with the established Zenitsu color palette."

Task:
"Propose and execute a multi-part plan to resolve these integration issues:

    Fix Workspace Icon Rendering: Modify ~/.config/waybar/style.css. Add a new, more specific CSS rule targeting #workspaces button to ensure the correct font is used for the glyphs. This rule should be placed after the global * rule.
    CSS

#workspaces button {
    font-family: "FiraCode Nerd Font", "Symbols Nerd Font", sans-serif;
}

Correct Notification Center Position & Animation: Modify ~/.config/swaync/config.json. Set the control-center-positionX to "right" and control-center-positionY to "bottom". This will anchor the control center to the bottom right of the screen, causing it to animate upwards when toggled, directly above the Waybar.
JSON

{
  //... existing swaync config...
  "positionX": "right",
  "positionY": "bottom",
  "control-center-positionX": "right",
  "control-center-positionY": "bottom",
  //... rest of config...
}

Apply Thematic Transparency to Notifications: Modify ~/.config/swaync/style.css. Update the rules for .notification and .control-center to use a semi-transparent background color via the alpha() function, while retaining the thematic border.
CSS

    /* Add or modify these rules in swaync/style.css */

.notification {
background-color: alpha(@charcoal-dark, 0.85); /* 85% opacity */
border: 2px solid @haori-orange;
border-radius: 0;
}

.control-center {
background-color: alpha(@charcoal-dark, 0.85); /* 85% opacity */
border: 2px solid @haori-orange;
border-radius: 0;
}
```

    Unify System Notifications:
    a.  Eliminate Conflicts: Generate a command to ensure no other notification daemons are running and conflicting with swaync.
    bash killall -q dunst mako 
    b.  Reroute Audio Notifications: Explain that to capture volume/mute notifications, the keybinds in hyprland.conf must be updated to call a script that uses notify-send (or dunstify). Provide the following example modification for the volume mute keybind, which sends a notification with a specific ID (-r 9993) to replace previous volume notifications.

    Find the bind for XF86AudioMute in ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf and replace its exec command with this:

    bind = , XF86AudioMute, exec, pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle && notify-send -e -h string:x-canonical-private-synchronous:volume -r 9993 -u low " Volume" "$(pactl get-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@)"
    ```"
