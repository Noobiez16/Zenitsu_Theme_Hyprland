🔧 ISSUES THAT WERE FIXED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ✓ Icons Not Displaying
   PROBLEM: Electrical icons (⚡, , ) not showing in waybar
   CAUSE: Sed patterns in script didn't match actual icon codes
   FIX: Updated sed patterns to match exact icon codes in modules

2. ✓ Waybar Disappearing After Script
   PROBLEM: Running electrify_icons_and_sounds.sh caused waybar to vanish
   CAUSE: Multiple issues:
          - CSS animation appended multiple times (duplicates)
          - Some sed patterns created syntax errors
   FIX: 
          - Added duplicate detection in script
          - Created clean_css_duplicates.sh utility
          - Fixed sed patterns to be more specific

3. ✓ CSS Duplicate Entries
   PROBLEM: Click animation CSS added 4+ times to Thunder Glow.css
   CAUSE: Script didn't check if animation already exists
   FIX: Added grep check before appending CSS
        Created cleanup utility to remove duplicates

4. ✓ Icon Replacement Not Working
   PROBLEM: Some icons changed, others didn't
   CAUSE: Sed patterns too generic, matched wrong lines
   FIX: Made sed patterns more specific:
          - Used exact icon codes instead of wildcards
          - Used pipe delimiters instead of slashes
          - Added context matching for specific modules

🔄 IMPROVEMENTS TO electrify_icons_and_sounds.sh
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BEFORE:
  • Sed patterns too generic
  • CSS appended without checking for duplicates
  • No validation of changes
  • Could break waybar if run multiple times

AFTER:
  • More specific sed patterns
  • Duplicate detection before appending CSS
  • Better echo messages
  • Safe to run multiple times

SPECIFIC CHANGES:
  
  Network Icons:
    OLD: s/"format-wifi": "{icon}"/"format-wifi": " {icon}"/
    NEW: s/"format-wifi": "󰖩 {icon}"/"format-wifi": " {icon}"/
    WHY: More specific, matches exact current icon

  Bluetooth Icons:
    OLD: s/"format": " "/"format": " "/
    NEW: s/"format": "󰂯 "/"format": " "/
    WHY: Matches actual bluetooth icon in config

  CSS Appending:
    OLD: cat >> "$GLOW_CSS" << 'CLICKCSS' ...
    NEW: if ! grep -q "CLICK SPARK ANIMATION" ...
    WHY: Only append if not already present

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ CURRENT STATUS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 HOW TO USE THE FIX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FOR FIRST TIME SETUP:
  $ cd ~/Project_Zenitsu_Theme
  $ ./apply_electrical_icons.sh
  $ pkill waybar && waybar &

IF ICONS AREN'T SHOWING:
  $ cd ~/Project_Zenitsu_Theme
  $ ./fix_zenitsu_icons.sh

IF CSS HAS DUPLICATES:
  $ cd ~/Project_Zenitsu_Theme
  $ ./clean_css_duplicates.sh

IF WAYBAR IS BROKEN:
  1. Check TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.txt
  2. Restore from backup:
     $ cd ~/.config/waybar
     $ cp ZenitsuModules.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS ZenitsuModules
  3. Reapply icons:
     $ cd ~/Project_Zenitsu_Theme
     $ ./apply_electrical_icons.sh

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 TESTING RESULTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Waybar Starts: YES
✓ Icons Applied: YES
✓ CSS Clean: YES (1 animation copy)
✓ No Errors in Log: YES
✓ Click Animation Works: YES (when clicked)
✓ Scripts Executable: YES

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📝 NOTES FOR USER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Font Requirement:
   Icons will only display if Nerd Fonts are installed.
   Check with: fc-list | grep -i nerd
   Install: sudo pacman -S ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd

2. Sound System:
   Click sounds require additional configuration.
   Sound files are created but need to be integrated with
   waybar module actions (on-click handlers).

3. Multiple Runs Safe:
   All new scripts can be run multiple times safely.
   They check before making changes and create backups.

4. Backup Location:
   All backups are timestamped in the same directory as original:
   ~/.config/waybar/ZenitsuModules.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
   ~/.config/waybar/style/*.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

5. CSS Symlink:
   The style.css is a symlink to Thunder Breathing.css
   which is in Hyprland-Dots directory.
   Thunder Glow.css is the enhanced version with animations.
